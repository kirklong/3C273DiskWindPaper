The model (lightly documented in the code, more robustly documented in the paper) is contained as the Julia module [`DiskWind`](DiskWind). A sample Python fitting script is contained in [`PTemceeFit.py`](PTemceeFit.py). The GRAVITY data used to fit the model are contained in the Pickle file [`3c273_juljanmarmay_append_gilles_specirf_wide_v6.p`](3c273_juljanmarmay_append_gilles_specirf_wide_v6.p). If you have any questions please reach out as I am more than happy to help/explain more, and if you find this work useful please cite our paper.
